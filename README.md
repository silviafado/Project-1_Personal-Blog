# Project-1_Personal-Blog

# Introduction
This project requires to utilize your HTML and CSS skills to build out a personal blog website, including custom images, layout, and styling. Along with webpage design considerations, is important to work to appropriately structure the files, as well as use proper CSS and HTML formatting & style.

# Project Files
In this project, I have started from scratch defining my own interface layout and styling the CSS. The main topic of the blog is wellness and creativity, so all the posts linked to the main page will be about this topic and all pages are styled according to this field aesthetics.
The project has 3 pages:

- The blog website, homepage where the other pages are linked.
- 1st blog post: 'Anti-Inflammatory Turmeric Latte', which links to the receipe page.
- 2nd blog post: 'About me...', talkes about me and my creative background.

The other 2 posts linked in the homepage are posts that I have written for a fashion brand and created the post with wordpress.
